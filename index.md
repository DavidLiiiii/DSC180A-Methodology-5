Domain: From Theory to Pixels: Diffusion Models for Image and Data Generation
Mentors: Alex Cloninger, Rayan Saab

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
Diffusion model is the main topic discussed in my domain and is pretty interesting and cool. It can learn existing images using a forward process by adding noise to them gradually, and create new and photorealistic images containing objects that do not exist in the real world through a reverse diffusion process. Among the topics discussed this quarter, the most interesting one is studying how a data point moves in the forward diffusion process, and if the same data point would move to the original place in the reverse process.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One potential investigation is to tackle the inverse problems in quarter 2. Inverse problems are a general category, containing de-blurring, inpainting, etc. We aim to study if diffusion models can be used to solve inverse problems in general, hopping to use a single model to achieve different tasks.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One potential change I would make is implementing more kinds of diffusion models. Currently, we are working on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) mainly and performing differently experiments on it. If time allows, I would try different diffusion models such as DDIMs and would compare the performance of them so as to choose the baseline model for the quarter 2 project.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
One other technique I would be interested in is the underlying mathematical theory behind the diffusion model. If possible, I would be interested in how theory supports the results that we have obtained, especially how new images are generated and why different parts from different images can be somehow combined into a single new photo.
